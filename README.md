Bookie is planned to be desktop application to exchange second-hand textbooks.  Inside the application, users will post a textbook and wait for a buyer in their local area  to reach them. After the seller has been contacted, they can decide on a price, and a meeting  place to trade the textbook.\

Code Organization: Firstly, the model classes like User and Listing class are coded. Then, these classes were put 
together and made compatible with each other. Secondly, the view classes are designed in Netbeans IDE, using 
Java's Swing and AWT libraries. Then, the source code of the components were taken from Netbeans IDE and implemented 
in seperate classes using VS Code and IntelliJ Idea. Thirdly, the test classes and controller classes for these UI files were implemented.
Lastly, all of these classes were put together and made arrangements so that they can interact between each other. 
After debugging, a demo class was implemented and tested.\
